# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

The "Sonar Rock vs. Mine Prediction" project involves the application of machine learning techniques to distinguish between underwater objects as either rocks or mines using sonar data. Sonar signals are collected and processed to extract relevant features, which serve as input to machine learning algorithms. 

During the training phase, the algorithms learn to recognize patterns and characteristics indicative of either rocks or mines in the sonar signals. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to assess the model's performance accurately. Various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are employed to gauge the model's effectiveness.


Once trained, the model can classify new sonar signals into either the rock or mine category. This technology has practical applications in naval defense, underwater exploration, and marine resource management. The project's success is measured by its ability to accurately predict the classification of underwater objects, contributing to safer navigation and improved underwater operations.

In this project, we have used Logistic Regression.
